# Contributing

First off, **thank you** for considering to contribute! I aim to build an
inclusive community around _Beachy Beachy Ball_. You should know that there
are many ways to contribute. You can write tutorials, create videos or blog posts,
improve the documentation, submit issues (such as bug reports or feature requests), as well as write actual code.
All of these are very worthwhile contributions and are more than welcome!

All contributors will be added in the designated section in the project's readme file.

### _Beachy Beachy Ball_ is in active development, so if you have any ideas or want to help, feel free to:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature)
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature')
4. Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
5. Open a Pull Request to the develop branch
